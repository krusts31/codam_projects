#TRY TO BRAKE MY PRORAMM

#	hashtage was introduced by me to coment on rt files have fun with that :D

#	!!!R IS THE RESOLUTION!!!

#	Rules: ONE PER RT FILE
#	Example-> one letter folowed by a space number 2nd space and 2nd number

R 720 720

#ambient ligthin only should appera once
#	Rull intesity should be in range of 1 to 0
#	RGB color range 3 numbers in range from 0 to 255
#	255,255,255
#	example

A 0.4 100,240,100

#	RULLES FOR ALL THE OBJECTS
#	THESE OBJECT CAN APPEAR AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE
#	OR NOT APPER AT ALL
#	CORDINATES ARE REPRESENTED BY 3 FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
#	SPERAITED BY COMMAS
#	SURFACE NORMAL VECTOR MODULES ARE EXPECTED TO BE == 1
#	RGB VALUES ARE 3 NUMBERS IN THE RANG OF 0 TO 255
#	DIAMETER, HEIGHT, SIDE SIZE ARE ONE FLOATING POINT NUMBER

c 5,5,5 -0.57,-0.57,-0.57 0 

#sp	sphear can appera as many times as you wish
#	represent by letres "sp"
#	3 floats to represent cordinates of the center
#	12,2,0
#	radius float must be positive
#	23
#	RGB* color range 3 numbers in range from 0 to 255
#	100,23,122
#	example

sp 24036,2483,200000 2 255,255,2

#tr	triangle can appera as many times as you like
#	cordinates of edge 1
#	12,2,2
#	cordinates of edge 2
#	123.2,1,-42
#	cordinates of edge 3
#	12.2,0,23
#	RGB color range 3 numbers in range from 0 to 255
#	100,23,122
#	example

tr 2,0,0 -2,0,0 0,0,2 255,0,123

#cy	cylinder can appear as many times as you like
#	cordinates of cy center 3 floats sperate by comas
#	12,23,2
#	"normal vector*"
#	-0.461197,-0.883962,0.076866
#	next is dyameter which is a float
#	12.2
#	then the height of the cylinder is a float
#	2.2
#	RGB color range 3 numbers in range from 0 to 255
#	100,23,122
#	example

cy 2,4,4.2 0,1,0 0.5 2 255,0,0

#sq	square can appear as many times as you like
#	cordinates of sq center
#	1.2,123,2
#	normal
#	0,1,0
#	size of the side
# 	12.2
#	RGB 
#	244,0,23
#	example

sq 1.2,32,2 0,1,0 12 23,9,0

#pl	plain
#	cordinates of the center of the plain
#	1,2,4
#	normal vector
#	0,-1,0
#	RGB color
#	255,2,12
#	example

pl 2,23,2 0,-1,0 233,233,55






#	"normal vector" is the orentation of a object
#	how is it rotaed in 3d space?
#	WARNING 
#	the lebgth of the normal which is calculated by squaring all 3 numbers and 
#	adding all the numbers and doing a sqrt from the resulting number
#	has to be exactly == 1
#	to make it easier to test normal run make dround to be able to
#	pass any value you like in the normal and miniRT will proportunaly
#	convert it to a a module of 1"
#	OR use the norm programm in src/norm
#
#	RGB R = red G = green B = blue
