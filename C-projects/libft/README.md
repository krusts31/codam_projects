# libft

My very first library! This is also my first porject I ever did at Codam.

I __failed 13 times__ on this project! Thas why I love 42, you can just retry and try again till you succseed.
What I about:
1. I learned about the baisics of `Makefile`.
2. The coding format standart.
3. How to handle edge cases in C
3.1. `int` overflows.
3.2.
I learned about how to format code, how to handle edge cases in C, like integer over flows, how to protect against malloc returning NULL, how to '\0' my string, when to use memmove, how to free memmory, how to spot memmory leaks, how to use pointers. I learned how to use exsiting unit tests to test my code, I learned about unnecessary header inclusin about out of bounds memmory, when to use size_t. To work with linked lists. How to make a baisic Makefile, how to use header guards. I larned about type casting, what do `-Wall -Werror -Wextra.` How to turn .c files in to .o files and link them in to a lib.
