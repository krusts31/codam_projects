# CPP modules

##### this is where I learned the baisics of CPP

### My journey

I have tried a bit of `java, php, python` before this, but I did not get how OOP worked, what was that `object.` syntax about and what the hell is a constructor it all just seamd uncomprehandable and I could not really reason about the code I was copying from the internet. Well after the CPP modules I understood the baisics of OOP quit well. :)

What I leared:
Module0
1. How to make objects
2. How to make a `abstract class`
