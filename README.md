In June 2019, I began my journey into the world of computer science with Codam's Piscine program. It was the start of an adventure that has since transformed my life in ways I could never have imagined. Fast forward to April 2020, and I embarked on my core studies, where I delved deeper into the intricacies of software development.

What drew me to Codam was the freedom to learn and grow at my own pace and in my own style. The supportive community, combined with the rigorous curriculum, gave me the confidence to push my boundaries and explore new avenues in my learning journey. I fell in love with the process of discovery, and the sense of achievement that came with mastering complex concepts.

Throughout my core studies, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, honing my skills in C, C++, DevOps, sysadmin, python, networking, and much more. I'm proud to say that I completed each project with passion and precision, each one adding to my knowledge and experience in unique ways.

Looking back, I can honestly say that Codam has been the most fulfilling and rewarding experience of my life. It has given me the tools and the confidence to pursue my dreams in the field of computer science, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next.
