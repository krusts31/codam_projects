# CPP modules

##### this is where I learned the basics of CPP

### My journey

I have tried a bit of `java, php, python` before this, but I did not get how OOP worked, what was that `object.` syntax about and what the hell is a constructor it all just seemed uncomprehensible and I could not really reason about the code I was copying from the internet. Well after the CPP modules I understood the basics of OOP quite well. :)
