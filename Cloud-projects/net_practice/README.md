Intro:

This project is about solving <strong>networking</strong> problems to make a network run.
The following will be 10 diffrent problems solved by using <strong>GNS3</strong>

### Motivation:
I did not understand what the subject ment by these fields:

I kind of understood what routing tables and interfaces are but had no idea how they actualy work, like why when I put the router on the same subnet as the host they managed to talk or why some configurations did what theye did.. There was a lot of confusion about the subject, so I decided to emulate the subject topologies in a virtual enviorment with virtual host and virtual routers.

### What is in this project

every lvl has the assigned problem and then a break down on what is what, why it works, and possibly some practical examples, but I do not explain everything.

If u also would like to play around with networking I suggest using **GNS3**.
