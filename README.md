Piscine in 2019 June. Core studies started in 2020. April 13.

I was on a quest to learn computerscince but I did not know it at the time. I join Codam because it was a place where I felt safe to devlop in my won way at my own pace and in my own style. I loved it. Here are all the projects that I completed durning my Core studies.
