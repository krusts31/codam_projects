2. The coding format standards.
3. How to handle user input.
4. I learned about interesting things in C like:

> INT OVERFLOWS
>
> DEREFERENCING NULL
>

> 
> OUT-OF-BOUNDS MEMORY ACCESS

5. Learned about \0 strings.
6. When to use memmove vs memcpy.
7. How to compile .c file into .o files.
8. How to link all the .o files into.a file.
9. The benefits of compiling with -Wall -Werror -Wextra..
