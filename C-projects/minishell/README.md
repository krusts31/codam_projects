# minishell

First of all thank you Dustin for doing this project with me!

it can handel pipes up to 255, here docs, redirections < >
built ins: cd, echo, export, unset

Well before hand I was quit akward in shell and as Dustin said: "This is when you really start to live in the shell". Not sure if he ment it but it was kind of true.

Its my own `minibash/minizsh`. Its the most shit code we have writen. Ever. But I learned a lot about how the shell works.
