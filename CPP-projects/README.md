# C++

##### CPP_piscine is a introduction to c++

##### ft_webserv only works on macos since it uses kqueue
The goal is to write a webserver in C++. I would say that this project does not make sense to be writen in C++, it would be better to write a webserver in C, just like nginx.
What I learend was how to use:
1. File descriptors for socket comunication.
2. How a webserver works.
3. How requests and response fields work.
4. The diffrence between presisten and non presisten connection.
5. A bit of TDD.
6. How http protocol works.
7. How webserver talks to a cgi.
8. How to configure a webserver.
9. Testing the webserver with `siege`
